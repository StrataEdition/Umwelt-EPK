*Across its runtime, Onas Ueno builds immersive soundscapes that shift and fragment like thoughts mid-formation. Blending ambient atmospheres, digital dissonance, and tactile textures, **Umwelt** sketches a fragmented world—half hyper-real, half doodle. The title, Umwelt—borrowed from the German term for 'the world as experienced by a particular organism'—serves as a guiding principle in the formation of the songs, allowing the sounds to evolve with a sense of self-determination*
